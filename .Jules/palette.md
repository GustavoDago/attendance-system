## 2025-05-15 - Improving Login Accessibility and Feedback
**Learning:** Standard login forms often lack proper ARIA associations and visual feedback for async actions, which negatively impacts screen reader users and users with slower connections.
**Action:** Always associate `label` with `input` using `id`/`htmlFor`, add `autoComplete` for password managers, and implement a `loading` state to disable the submit button and provide clear visual feedback during authentication.
